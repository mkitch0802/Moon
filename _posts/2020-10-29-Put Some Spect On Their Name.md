**Put Some ‘Spect On Their Name**

This week, for one of my other classes I had to conduct a technology review on a digital tool. The guidelines of the assignment specified that we could select an app or other online platform that might be used in the classroom during these pandemic times. We were asked to choose a few different tools (anything from Instagram to Zoom or Canvas), play around with them a bit in order to become familiar with their features, and then select one to focus on for our review. 

The main purpose of the assignment was to investigate how a particular technology could potentially be integrated into a person’s teaching and how it could possibly help with workflow and communication between members of a class. Some of these apps were those that I had been familiar with previously, others, I was not. We had a series of questions to consider and some of them were very specific (asking about the cost or features of the technology), but some were a little more philosophical. 

An example of one of these questions we had to respond to was “who is this technology designed for?” I remembered an article I read a while back that talked about how [the tech industry is dominated by white males](https://qz.com/940660/tech-is-overwhelmingly-male-and-men-are-just-fine-with-that/), so I started thinking more about this. For example if an industry is dominated by one group, it makes sense that they are designing technology mostly with themselves (white males) in mind. Given that, it is unlikely that they are intentionally designing technology with me—a Black man—in mind.

This assignment question made me think further on this topic: how involved are Black people in today’s digital age? Well, we are definitely users of technology, that’s for sure. Apps like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are probably three of the largest social media platforms (though TikTok may be catching up) and have a huge Black presence. But in terms of introducing these tech platforms? Not so much. When it comes to adapting them and making it our own, however, we are successful. 

An article by Farhad Manjoo in Salon from early 2010 is one of the first to talk about Black adaptation of Twitter in [“How Black People Use Twitter.”](https://slate.com/technology/2010/08/how-black-people-use-twitter.html) Manjoo discusses the cultural practice of “playing the dozens” and how the use of “blacktags” helps to facilitate this through making “call and response” easy. From these early interactions on Twitter emerged what has been termed [“Black Twitter.”](https://news.virginia.edu/content/black-twitter-101-what-it-where-did-it-originate-where-it-headed)

[Black Twitter has also given rise to a number of political activism movements that originated by hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter, #SayHerName, #ICantBreathe, and #MeToo.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/23/ten-years-black-twitter-watchdog) Along with the serious, there are also the memes in the form of repeated phrases and popular GIFS. Often times though, we don’t get credit for this work.

This also got me thinking about a chapter we read in my Intro to DH class this week by Marisa Parham titled “Sample|Signal|Strobe: Haunting, Social Media, and Black Digitality.” Parham compares the Black Experience overall to the fractured nature of the digital world and I would take that a step further to mean that our contributions online are not clear and valued (even as they are appropriated by others). 

One of the other questions to answer on our technology review was whether the platform scraped or sold user data and though for my chosen platform (Slack), the answer was no, for many others, that is not the case. And when our user data is sold to advertisers and we buy products since [Black people have the most buying power in America—more than one trillion dollars](https://newsone.com/3901998/black-buying-power-by-numbers-history-making/) then this is just one more way that others are profiting off of us.

This is one of the reasons that I want to get more involved in DH, so I can be part of the solution to make tech more equitable—so it is designed with all users in mind from the beginning.
